### Browse & Filter

Both hosts and guests can browse and filter by:
- City
- Age
- Languages
- Date

### Matching Flow

```
1. User browses listings (hosts see guests, guests see hosts)

2. Either side can initiate:
   - Host clicks "Invite" on a guest
   - Guest clicks "Become a guest" on a host

3. Other party gets email notification

4. They accept or decline:
   - Accept → Both get contact details, moved to "Christmas matches" page
   - Decline → Requester gets polite "no" email

5. Celebrate together 🎄
```

### Pages Needed

1. **Landing page** ✅ (done)
2. **Registration** - Host flow
3. **Registration** - Guest flow
4. **Browse listings** - with filters (city, age, languages, date, photos, verified)
5. **Profile view** - individual host/guest detail
6. **Messages** - inbox/conversation view
7. **Christmas matches** - confirmed matches with contact details
8. **My profile** - edit own profile, see pending invitations
9. **Photo verification** - upload live photo to verify (optional)
10. **Terms of Service / Privacy Policy**

### Core Decisions Summary

- **Discovery model**: Browse-based with filtering

- **Selection process**: Mutual confirmation required
- **Photos**: Optional

## Legal/Safety Notes

All comparable apps (TimeLeft, 222, Couchsurfing) use the same legal approach:

**Terms of Service must include:**
- Statement that you are a "platform" not a party to interactions
- Full liability release - users release the company from claims
- User warranties: 18+, no violent/sexual crime history, agreement not to misuse
- GDPR compliance statement (required in EU/Lithuania)
- Right to terminate accounts, reporting mechanism

**For Lithuania specifically:**
- GDPR compliance required from day one
- Consider whether VšĮ (nonprofit entity) registration is needed, or if informal operation is okay for MVP

**Key difference from TimeLeft/222**: Those apps use public venues as a safety layer. Private home hosting shifts more risk to users — Terms of Service language matters more.


## Comparable Apps

**Most similar model (home hosting, mutual matching):**

| App | Model | Key Difference |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| **Couchsurfing** | Browse hosts, send request, mutual accept | For travelers, not holidays |
| **Couchers.org** | Same as CS, free/nonprofit | Direct CS replacement |
| **BeWelcome** | Same as CS, free/nonprofit | Smaller, open source |

**Nešvęsk vienas is unique**: Combines home hosting with seasonal/holiday focus + support for Ukrainian refugees. Nobody else is doing exactly this.
