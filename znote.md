# Product Notes

## Onboarding Flow

- **Full-screen experience** - No sidebar or distractions, similar to Typeform
- **Skip option** - Users can skip onboarding and complete their profile later
  - If skipped, prompt to complete profile when they try to connect with someone
  - Skipped users default to "guest" role
- **Form UX** - Should start from top of screen each time
- **Google login** - Auto-populate available info from Google account

## Host vs Guest Experience

- Consider if hosting and going experiences should be fundamentally different flows

- Easy text updates for marketing content
